# React Portfolio

## Description

This is the source code for the Portfolio MVP. I've built this to show what I can do and provide a place for me to connect to the world. My corner of the internet built with my own hands. This should hopefully help get the word out that I'm able to write web code and a nice front end. This is really the first major project I've done with React.

## Usage
The production version of this should be available soon. When it is, I'll update the link here.


## Installation (Development version)

- Download the code.
- run `npm i` and the `npm run dev` to see the development version.
